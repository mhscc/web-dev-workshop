# üöÄ JavaScript Basics

JavaScript is the most widely used programming language for web development.

### ‚≠ê Getting Started

1. Ensure that live server extension is installed
2. If you haven't already, create an HTML document(e.g `index.js`).
3. A CSS file is not necessary in this example
4. If you haven't already, install nodeJS
5. Create a JavaScript file named `index.js` in your folder
6. Inside your HTML file, enter this code on a new line before the closing body tag:

   ```html
   <script src="index.js"></script>
   ```

   For example:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>

   <html>
     <body>
       <!--some code-->

       <!-- Add this line of code -->
       <script src="index.js"></script>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

#### ‚ùì Where do I see JavaScript outputs?

7. Open the developer tools in your browser by using the keyboard shortcuts ‚Äì `Ctrl + Shift + I` for Windows or Linux and `Cmd + Option + I` for macOS users. Note that is for Chrome, only. Alternatively, you can right-click and client on `Inspect Element` or `Inspect`.
8. Navigate to the `console` tab

#### ‚ùì How do I run JavaScript on my terminal?

1. Open a new terminal on Visual Studio Code
2. Type in `node [filename].js` in our case type in `node index.js`

### üß∫ Variables and Data Types

> #### <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edlFjlzxkSI" target="_blank">Video Tutorial</a>



Think of variables as containers that stores values. To declare a variable use `var`, `let` or `const` followed by variable name, equal sign then the value.
To print out the statement to the console/terminal use `console.log()`

As long as the scope of the variable is reached, it may be used to `console.log()`, use it in a function and constructors if the data type is valid, and <b>most importantly</b>, variables are case-sensitive, you can only call them exactly how you spelled, don't miss a single letter, spelling, and capitalization.

```javascript
var age = 4;
let myName = 'Bob Joe';
const word = 'Big';

// print the word
console.log(word);

// print myName
console.log(myName);

// This is a comment it does not have any effect on the code

/*
  or you can also do it like this
  and make it multi-line
 */
```

#### There are **5** commonly used data types:

![](/static_files/javascript_datatypes.png)

### ‚ûó Operators

> #### <a href="(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZzyij43A54" target="_blank">Video Tutorial</a>

> Operators are Symbols used to perform operations on operands

Generally, all operators require you to have the same data type. Integers and Strings can't be added together, but integer and integer, so can is Strings to Strings.

```javascript
/* few examples */

let a = 10;
let b = 4;

let ABadd = 10 + 4;
let ABmultiple = a * 4; // for multplication

a += 5; // add 5 to a. New value of a is 15

let firstWord = 'chi';
let secondWord = 'p';

let firstsecondWord = firstword + secondWord; // results into "chip"
```

**The 5 types of operators are**:

1. Arithmetic Operator (common)
2. Comparison Operator (common)
3. Bitwise Operator
4. Logical Operator (common)
5. Assignment Operators (common)
6. Special Operators

You do not have to learn Bitwise Operator at the moment because there is little usage as of now.

### üí• Conditionals

> #### <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsG4Xd6LlsM&t=135s" target="_blank">Video Tutorial</a>


>
> Conditionals are used when you want your program to perform different actions based on different conditions. In short, if we want to have logic in our program we use conditionals

**Question:** print `Hello` if `myAge` is greater than `10`, `No` if `myAge` is between `5` and `10` inclusive, `HAHAHA` if `myAge` is less than `5`

```javascript
let myAge = 11;

/* solution here */
```

**Solution:** use conditional statements

```javascript
let myAge = 11;

/* solution here */
if (myAge > 10) {
  console.log('Hello');
} else if (myAge >= 5) {
  console.log('No');
} else {
  console.log('HAHAHA');
}
```

### üî∂ Functions

> #### <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8ap4k_1QEQ&t=4s" target="_blank">Video Tutorial</a>


Function is a block of code that performs certain task

A function can have parameters.

- Paramater are listed inside the paranthesis of the function
- Arguments are the values recieved by the function when it is invoked

**Example:**

```javascript
/* create a function that will print your age + 5 */
let myAge = 10;

function getAge(age) {
  return age + 5;
}

console.log(getAge(myAge));

/* output */
15;

/* The parameter is age and the argument in this case is myAge or 10.*/
```

From the code above we see that the function returns age + 5. Keep in mind that **JavaScript will not execute any code after the return statement** because the function stops executing when it reaches there.

To use a function simply do `[function name](argument)`, in our case it is `getAge(myAge)`

**Scope of variables:**
Variables declared inside a function can only be used within the function

```javascript
/* will not work */
console.log(car);

function myFunction() {
  let car = 'toyota';

  /* will work */
  console.log(car);
}

/* will not work */
console.log(car);
```

#### But why use functions?

> The golden rule in programming is reusability
> Define the code once, use it many times

---

### ‚ôªÔ∏è What if I want to execute my code multiple times?

> #### <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn06785pkJg&t=297s" target="_blank">Video Tutorial</a>


> Use loops, loops can execute a block of code a number of times

There are **5 types of loops**: `while` loop, `for` loop, `for/in` loop, `for/of` loop and `do/while` loop

#### `for` loop

```js
for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

Result:

```js
0;
1;
2;
3;
4;
```

---

#### `for/in` loop

```javascript
const person = { fname: 'John', lname: 'Doe', age: 25 };

for (let x in person) {
  console.log(person[x]);
}
```

Result:

```js
John;
Doe;
25;
```

`x` is the key so when we do `person[x]` we are basically saying `person[fname]`

---

#### `for/of` loop

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

for (let number of numbers) {
  console.log(number);
}
```

Result:

```js
1;
2;
3;
4;
5;
6;
```

---

#### `while` loop

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}

let i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

// result
0;
1;
2;
3;
4;
```

#### `do/while` loop

```javascript
let i = 5;

do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i > 5 && i < 10);

//result
5;
6;
7;
8;
9;
```

The code will execute once and then check the condition therefore `5` was printed even though it is not between `5` and `10` exclusive

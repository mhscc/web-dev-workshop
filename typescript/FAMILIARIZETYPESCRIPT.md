TypeScript offers all of JavaScript features but in addition to that it is [strongly typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing)

## Getting started

1. If you haven't already install TypeScript, refer to [Installing DEV Tools](/INSTALL_DEV_TOOLS.md)

## Most Important Things to Know

TypeScript accepts JavaScript code but it has types

### Data Types

These are unit of data: numbers, strings, boolean and structures

### Interface

Interface defines structure of an object

![](/static_files/interface.png)

Which can then be used create an object that conforms with the structure defined with the interface. If the object does not match, an error will be returned

Once again, TypeScript is JavaScript with a type system. Using TypeScript lowers the chance of bugs in your program.

If you know JavaScript, TypeScript will be easy to adapt to.
